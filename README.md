## What's new

2020-10-16

* The application has been updated for Monero's 0.17 hardfork
* Electron has been upgraded to Electron version 8
* The web wallet has been split off from the desktop wallet, to make ongoing development and support easier. The web wallet can now be found [here](https://github.com/mymonero/mymonero-app-js)
* Users are now able to exchange their XMR into BTC
* Code signing and notarization for MacOS & Windows
* The build process has been enhanced and simplified

## What to expect

The next major release will allow for Monero be exchanged into many other cyptocurrencies.

## Requirements & Install Locations

The desktop app is built on [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) and can be packaged to run on modern versions of:

* MacOS (.app)
* Windows (installer .exe)
* Linux (.appimage)

### Where is user data saved?

* Desktop: See Electron's [`app.getPath('userData')`](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/app.md#appgetpathname)



## Reporting Bugs & Making Feature Requests

If you would like to report an issue or share a feature request, please create a Github [Issue](https://github.com/mymonero/monero-app-js/issues) on this project.

If you're reporting a bug, be sure to include all information which we would need to reproduce the issue, such as the operating system and app version on which you saw the bug, and the steps you took, if you can tell.

# Contributing & Testing


## Getting the Source Code

### Download & Install

1. First, ensure that you have recent versions of `node` and `npm` installed.

2. Clone or otherwise download this repository. Then, in your terminal, `cd` into the repo directory.

3. (To get the bleeding edge, and/or if you are going to make changes) Switch to the `develop` branch by executing `git checkout develop`.

4. Install all required `node_modules` by executing `npm install`.

5. Run `npm start` to open the wallet without building.

## Building for Production

If you're testing a pre-release version of this app and need to verify its behavior in production mode or want to obtain an installable release bundle, see [Packaging the App for Production Mode](./docs/PRODUCTION_BUILDS.md).

## Running in Development Mode

### Desktop

*Does not require you to package, sign, and install the app, and will cause the Developer window to be shown. Certain features, such as URL opening under MacOS, require production build.*

`npm run dev`


## Contributing

### Testing

Please submit any bugs as Issues unless they have already been reported.

Suggestions and feedback are very welcome!


### Developing

If you have an improvement to the codebase and would like to have your code shipped in the production MyMonero app, please submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/), even if it's still a WIP. We try to credit all contributors in app release notes.

Before contributing, please spend a few moments scanning the [technology notes](./docs/TECHNOLOGY.md) to learn about libraries used, reasons behind some architectural choices, and more.

* Merging PRs which involve integrating with any third-party services will require discussion and agreement.  

* We reserve the right to refuse to merge any PRs, such as those which introduce breaking changes.

The maintainer enjoys collaborating with volunteer contributors to the MyMonero apps over IRC private message and the #mymonero room on freenode.net (Come say hello!), so PR'd submissions do not have to be at all complete or perfect on their first submission. (To submit a draft PR for review, simply mark it as '[DO NOT MERGE]')

For background on this project, see [Why We Built the Native Apps](./docs/WHY_NATIVE.md).

You may also like to read the unofficial [Technology Roadmap](./docs/ROADMAP.md) to get a peek at what we're thinking about for the future.

There's also an icebox of ideas, features, improvements, known issues, and other todos waiting to be knocked out which are kept in the [Issues](https://github.com/mymonero/monero-app-js/issues) tracker.
